## Purpose
This is an app designed to help victims of NFT theft and phishing report their NFTs as stolen on Twitter and alert the NFT community.

### Technologies Used
The app's front-end is made with:
1. Material UI
2. Usedapp
3. React

The backend is made with:
1. NodeJs
2. Firestore Database
3. Firebase Cloud Functions
4. Twitter API
5. Solidity
6. Fantom Testnet Chain
7. Covalent API

### How It Works

Through the front-end users who have lost an NFT can make a report by visiting the following link: https://ntt.d269gmnra3gv5s.amplifyapp.com/

On the front-end, the user is required to fill three inputs:
1. NFT contract address
2. Token ID
3. Twitter Username

Once filled, the user is required to click on the FILE REPORT BUTTON to record the NFT details on the Fantom blockchain and post on the NFTReporterTool twitter page which posts a tweet with the name of the NFT, token ID and image URL.
